## Next Steps

### Create Remaining View Files
You need to create the view files listed in the "View Files Needed" section above. Use the existing onisans and news views as templates.

### Integration with Public Site
Update your public PageController to fetch content from the database:
```php
public function about() {
    $page = Page::where('slug', 'about-us')->published()->firstOrFail();
    return view('pages.about', compact('page'));
}
```

### Use Site Settings in Layouts
In your main layout file:
```php
@php
    $settings = \App\Models\SiteSetting::getSettings();
@endphp

<title>{{ $settings->site_name }} - @yield('title')</title>
```

## Security Notes
- All admin routes are protected by `auth` and `admin` middleware
- File uploads are validated (type and size)
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Old files are deleted when updated
- SQL injection protection via Eloquent

## Performance Considerations
- Use pagination (15 items per page)
- Eager loading for relationships
- Image optimization recommended
- Consider caching for site settings

## Support & Customization
All controllers and models are fully documented and follow Laravel best practices. You can easily extend functionality by:
- Adding new fields to models
- Creating custom scopes
- Adding validation rules
- Implementing additional filters

## File Upload Limits
- Images: Max 5MB (heroes, pages, attractions)
- Media Library: Max 10MB
